//  VMA209 - Pot meter example
//  The VMA209 contains a blue potmeter (trimmer) which is connected to Analog 0
//  In this example we show You how to measure the voltage between 0 and 5V, and how to visualise it by the serial monitor
//  Programmed :Arduino IDE
//  Board ï¼šArduino Leonardo, UNO, MEGA

  Serial.print("Pot = ");// Write "Pot = " to the serial monitor
  Serial.println(PotBuffer);    // Now print the actual value measured by A0 (Pot or PotBuffer), TURN the small screw on top of the blue trimmer and You will see a value between 0 and about 1000
